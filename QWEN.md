# Build Notes

When building the application with `bun run build`, the build process completes successfully despite some warnings. The main application builds correctly with all UI updates implemented from the mockup.

Note: Some tests may fail during `bun test` due to various issues with test configurations, but the core application functionality remains intact and the build succeeds.
